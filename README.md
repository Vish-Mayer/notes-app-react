## Brief

Notes application built in React.js using test driven development and object oriented design. Tested with Jest and Enzyme.    

## User Stories

 Using the required specifications, I devised a set of user stories to break down the tasks into smaller steps.

    As a client
    So that I can remember things,
    I would like to be able to create a note.

    As a client
    So that I can edit my thoughts,
    I would like to be able to edit a note.

    As a client
    So that I dont have too many notes,
    I would like to be able to delete a note.

## Approach
    
The key concepts that I attempted to adhere to were:

* Object-oriented design
* Test-driven development
* Concise methods
* Seperation of concerns
